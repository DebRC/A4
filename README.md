# Performance-Analysis-of-Live-Migration-using-KVM
This project evaluates live migration in virtualized environments using QEMU-KVM. Analysis includes monitoring downtime, service availability, and resource utilization. 

The project also analyzes efficiency gains and benefits in fault tolerance, resource optimization, and energy efficiency, and provides insights for optimizing virtualized environments.

## Project Structure
* `lib` folder contains the entire code used for the analysis and evaluation.
* A specific load test file `loadtest.c` is used to measure the metrics on different loads.
* Rest shell files are run on host and guest machines to continuosly moniter the migration situation.
* `report.pdf` and `presentation.pdf` contains a detailed explanation of the analysis with diagrams and screenshots.
